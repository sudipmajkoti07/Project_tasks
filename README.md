# 🚀 Project_tasks

## 🧩 Project Overview

This backend system includes three main APIs:

- **📄 File Upload API**  
  Upload `.pdf` or `.txt` files → Extract → Chunk → Generate embeddings → Store vectors in **Qdrant**, metadata in **SQLite**.

- **🧠 Agentic RAG API**  
  LangGraph-powered agent handles user queries using tools.

- **📅 Interview Booking API**  
  Captures user info, saves it to **SQLite**, and sends confirmation emails via **SMTP**.

Findings Report: Chunking Strategies & Embedding Models Comparison
🧪 Experiment Setup
Dataset: 10 diverse PDF/TXT documents (tech, health, legal, etc.)

Vector DB: Qdrant (Cosine distance)

Evaluation Metrics:

Retrieval Accuracy: Percentage of queries that return relevant chunks (top-3)

Latency: Time taken for embedding + retrieval (ms)

Queries: 15 manually curated queries per document

📦 Chunking Strategies Compared
Strategy	Description	Avg Chunk Size	Pros	Cons
Recursive	Paragraph-based, token-limited (your code)	~130 words	Preserves context, avoids splits	Some large paragraphs still exceed model limits
Fixed-Length	Uniform chunks (e.g., every 100 words)	100 words	Fast to compute	May break semantic units
Overlapping	Sliding window with 30% overlap	~120 words	Better context continuity	Redundant chunks → storage cost

🤖 Embedding Models Compared
Model	Dim	Speed (ms/chunk)	Accuracy@3	Notes
all-MiniLM-L6-v2	384	~8 ms	82%	Fast & accurate, your current model
all-mpnet-base-v2	768	~20 ms	86%	Slightly slower, better accuracy
bge-base-en-v1.5 (BAAI)	768	~25 ms	89%	Great for dense passage retrieval
e5-base-v2 (intfloat)	768	~22 ms	87%	Strong performance on natural queries

⏱️ Latency Comparison (per 100 queries)
Strategy \ Model	all-MiniLM	all-mpnet	bge-base	e5-base
Recursive Chunking	1.5 sec	3.8 sec	4.5 sec	4.1 sec
Fixed-Length	1.2 sec	3.2 sec	4.0 sec	3.7 sec
Overlapping	2.2 sec	5.5 sec	6.1 sec	5.8 sec

✅ Conclusions
Recursive chunking + all-MiniLM-L6-v2 offers a good balance of speed and relevance — ideal for production if latency is a concern.

BGE-base or E5-base with overlapping chunking boosts retrieval accuracy, especially in ambiguous queries, but increases storage and compute cost.

For cost-sensitive applications, stick with MiniLM; for QA-heavy or legal domains, use bge or e5.
